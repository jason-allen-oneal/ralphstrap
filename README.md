# SignalFrame

A local-first "situational awareness" dashboard that turns scattered signals (news, system events, personal metrics, alerts) into structured, low-noise intelligence.

Think OSINT meets personal command center, but without the social-media brain rot.

## Core Problem It Solves

People are drowning in inputs:
- News feeds
- Security alerts
- Market signals
- System logs
- Notifications
- Personal metrics

Most tools are:
- Cloud-locked
- Algorithm-driven
- Social-media-optimized
- Or built for enterprises only

SignalFrame is for technical users who want:
- Control
- Signal over noise
- Local processing
- Explicit rules, not opaque algorithms

## Core Philosophy
- Local-first by default
- Rules over recommendations
- No engagement algorithms
- Explicit trust boundaries
- Human-in-the-loop
